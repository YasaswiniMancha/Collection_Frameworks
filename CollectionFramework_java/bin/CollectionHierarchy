Basics
-------


classes implements an interface -This means that the class agrees to provide
 implementations for all of the methods defined by the interface.

classes extends another class- means one class inherits the properties of another class (inheritance in oop)

A class can only extend(inherit) one parent class.
A class can implement more than one interface in it.

interface extends another interface -means When one interface extends another interface, 
this is called "interface inheritance" in Java and means the child interface can access all the methods
that are declared in the parent interface



Collection Hierarchy
--------------------

Mind these
----> means implements (implements the methods defined in interface)
++++> means extends (inherits)
*  means  implementation class
# means interface


List # , Set #, Queue # ++++> Collection #  ++++> Iterable #

ArrayList *, Linkedlist *, Vector * ----> List #
stack *  ++++> Vector *   (Stack is subclass of the vector)


ArrayDeque *, LinkedList * ----> Deque #  
Deque #  ++++>  Queue #
ProrityQueue *----> Queue #


HashSet *, LinkedHashSet * ----> Set #
TreeSet * ----> Set
SortedSet# ++++> Set
